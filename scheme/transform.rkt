;; okay, let's write a version of this that works on programs that
;; aren't already decomposed into an evaluation context and a redex....

;; 1) don't use flatten, it's gross :). Just handle the lists correctly
;;   in their construction. See note in e-as
;; 2) you're missing parentheses around the argument in lambdas. This will
;;   prevent all the terms from running correctly; that means something
;;   entirely different in scheme.
;; 3) just use "lambda", not 位. The R6RS reduction semantics doesn't
;;   include this shorthand and all the test cases will fail.
;; 4) I still haven't taken a close enough look to see why (+ 3 4)
;;   is transformed into (+ ((car 3) 4)), but there's definitely at
;;   least one bug there, I'll warrant.

;; given a program, return the annotated version of it
