Thanks to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item My friends and family for supporting me unconditionally, bringing me food on many occasions, and reminding me to step outside every now and then.
    \item John Clements for putting up with me borrowing books for way too long, for being contagiously excited about programming languages, and for believing in me.
    \item Aaron Keen for putting in extra effort to help me out several times, for teaching me Rust, and for introducing me to type theory.
    \item Zo\"e Wood for pointing me exactly in the right direction, and to exactly the right people.
\end{itemize}
